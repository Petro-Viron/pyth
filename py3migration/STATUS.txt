as of 2015-06-28:

I have made the code nearly python2/python3-duocompatible by calling
python-modernize.
Comitted.

I have inserted requires = ['six'] into setup.py
Not committed.

I have then repaired many of the bytes-vs-str issues in 
pyth\plugins\rtf15\reader.py.
Dito for pyth\plugins\xhtml\writer.py.
The former in particular was tricky because most strings have to be handled
as bytestrings -- but not all of them.
See  http://pythonhosted.org/six/

These two now appear to work for ASCII and 8-bit non-ASCII characters in the RTF file,
at least for a simple RTF file.
Complex files and true Unicode remains to be seen.

TO DO:

Establish a set of system-level test cases,
with various input files with the relevant RTF features
(paragraphs, line breaks, page breaks, various characters, fonts,
 bold, italics, underline, hyperlink)
and coming from MS Word, Wordpad, OpenOffice.

Introduce proper handling of itemized lists (well, that is a
new feature actually).

Debug the other plugins.
