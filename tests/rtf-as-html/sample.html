<p><strong>Italics, accented letters, em dashes:</strong> Ptáček collaborated with Jones. what is called familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome (FASPS)—or very early risers—and has found almost 90 families.<em> Novel players in presynaptic vesicle trafficking.</em> To identify mutations in novel genes as well as genes that have previously been implicated in SV trafficking, we used the eyeless-FLP/FRT system to carry out four chemical mutagenesis screens. with apparent normal eye morphology (300,000 flies) for their ability to phototax (retained 10,000).</p>
